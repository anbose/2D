# Description

This is a code in C++ for simulation the diffusivity edge system as described in https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.010601 in 2-dimensional grid.

### Details

We use a local Lax-Wendorf method to formulate a setup for the simulation. This setup is inspired from these two papers : https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/110853807 and https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/060673308.

The directory contains the necessary files needed for the simulation. However, the file including functions could not be shared due to privacy measures. Interested people can contact me.
